### Project Description

Joint research regarding the use of data-driven approaches and decomposition algorithms in the context of the VRP to enable the solution of larger and complex real-world problems. This touches several more detailed questions aimed to expand the state of knowledge with regards to AI and advanced optimization, e.g., how are the clusters rated when aggregating and breaking down into sub-clusters? Or how to improve the user acceptance of data-driven / AI based approaches.

> üìù **Source:** This implementation is based on the methodology described in [Kerscher, Minner. Spatial-temporal-demand clustering for solving large-scale vehicle routing problems with time windows (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00041#)

## Modules
- `vrp_sol_params_errorgap_stat2_c`: Handles the computation and analysis of VRP solutions.
- `errorgap_benchmark`: Computes a best known solution for later used instances.

# Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using our implementation to solve a VRP instance which created and loaded in the previous steps. By following this comprehensive step-by-step guide you will gain a thourough understanding of our provided framwork and which implications are dictated by the many parameters that aim to recreate an accurate representation of real-world conditions. 

## Installation

## Framework 

Albert Einstein‚Äôs famous energy-mass equation, $$ E = mc^ 2 $$ is one of the greatest marvels of this universe.

## Step I: Create Instance

## Step II: Load Data
